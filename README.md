# MultiWiiConf PyQt5 GUI

## Overview

This project is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring and communicating with MultiWii flight controllers. Built using PyQt5, it provides a basic framework for sending and receiving MultiWii Serial Protocol (MSP) messages.

## Features

- Serial port connection interface
- Basic MSP message sending functionality
- Tabbed interface for future expansion (Gimbal and Servo settings)

## Current Functionality

1. **Connect Button**: Establishes a serial connection with the selected port.
2. **Send MSP Status Button**: Sends a basic MSP status request.
3. **Send PID Values Button**: Sends example PID values.

**Note**: Currently, only these three buttons are fully functional. Other GUI elements (sliders, checkboxes, etc.) are placeholders for future development.

## Testing Focus

The primary focus for testing is to verify if the instructions sent from the two functional buttons (Send MSP Status and Send PID Values) can be properly decoded by the hardware. Successful decoding of these messages will pave the way for implementing more complex instructions based on GUI inputs and hardware feedback.

## Setup and Running

1. Ensure you have Python and PyQt5 installed.
2. Adjust the serial port settings in the `get_serial_ports()` method to match your operating system.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python multiwiiconf_gui.py
   ```

## Known Issues and TODOs

1. **Serial Port Compatibility**: The current implementation uses hardcoded serial port names. This needs to be adjusted based on the operating system in use.

2. **GUI Elements**: Most of the GUI elements (sliders, checkboxes, etc.) are currently non-functional placeholders. These will need to be connected to actual functionality in future development.

3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented, but more robust error checking and user feedback may be necessary.

4. **MSP Message Handling**: The current implementation only sends a few basic MSP messages. Future development will need to expand this to cover all necessary MSP commands.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper serial port detection and selection for different operating systems.
2. Connect GUI elements to actual MSP commands and flight controller parameters.
3. Implement real-time data reading and display from the flight controller.
4. Expand the MSP message handling to cover all necessary commands.

## Contributing

This project is in its early stages and contributions are welcome. Please ensure that any pull requests maintain the current functionality of the three working buttons while adding new features or improving existing code.
